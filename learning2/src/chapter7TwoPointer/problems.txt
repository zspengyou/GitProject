Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following operations: add and find.
add - Add the number to an internal data structure.
find - Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value.
add(1); add(3); add(5);
find(4) // return true
find(7) // return false


http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/remove-duplicate-numbers-in-array/
Given an array of integers, remove the duplicate numbers in it.

You should:
1. Do it in place in the array.
2. Move the unique numbers to the front of the array.
3. Return the total number of the unique numbers.

 Notice

You don't need to keep the original order of the integers.
Example
Given nums = [1,3,1,4,4,2], you should:

Move duplicate integers to the tail of nums => nums = [1,3,4,2,?,?].
Return the number of unique integers in nums => 4.
Actually we don't care about what you place in ?, we only care about the part which has no duplicate integers.


http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/two-sum-input-array-is-sorted/

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

 Notice

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
Example
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
return [1, 2]

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/two-sum-less-than-or-equal-to-target/

Given an array of integers, find how many pairs in the array such that their sum is less than or equal to a specific target number. Please return the number of pairs.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 24. 
Return 5. 
2 + 7 < 24
2 + 11 < 24
2 + 15 < 24
7 + 11 < 24
7 + 15 < 25


http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/two-sum-unique-pairs/

Given an array of integers, find how many unique pairs in the array such that their sum is equal to a specific target number. Please return the number of pairs.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given nums = [1,1,2,45,46,46], target = 47
return 2

1 + 46 = 47
2 + 45 = 47

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/two-sum-closest-to-target/

Given an array nums of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.

Return the difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 4.

The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).



http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/sort-colors/
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

 Notice

You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem. 
You should do it in-place (sort numbers in the original array).

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given [1, 0, 1, 2], sort it in-place to [0, 1, 1, 2].


http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/sort-colors-ii/
Given an array of n objects with k different colors (numbered from 1 to k), sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 1, 2, ... k.

 Notice

You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

k <= n

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given colors=[3, 2, 2, 1, 4], k=4, your code should sort colors in-place to [1, 2, 2, 3, 4].



http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/3sum/

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

 Notice

Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4}, A solution set is:

(-1, 0, 1)
(-1, -1, 2)


http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/partition-array/
Given an array nums of integers and an int k, partition the array (i.e move the elements in "nums") such that:

All elements < k are moved to the left
All elements >= k are moved to the right
Return the partitioning index, i.e the first index i nums[i] >= k.

 Notice

You should do really partition in array nums instead of just counting the numbers of integers smaller than k.

If all elements in nums are smaller than k, then return nums.length

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
If nums = [3,2,2,1] and k=2, a valid answer is 1.
